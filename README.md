Program allows users to check whether car spare part has a price in price file. Price file is a .CSV file with the newest parts prices. First seven characters in every row represents FINIS (car part number), than after coma two characters represent shortcut of market name, for example "AX" means "Austria". Program gets from user FINIS and path to price file, than checks every row for combination of finis + market shortcut.
